## Submission Instructions

### Overview
At its core, I want to create an application that encourages travel. It will include preloaded attractions and resources to help depending on your interest. My girlfriend and I like to visit national parks, and I try to have an annual trip with a friend of mine to new city for a NBA game every year.
